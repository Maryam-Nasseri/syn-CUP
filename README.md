## Key Terms and Concepts

### Syntactic Complexity
The word 'syntax' designates principles of the grammatical arrangement of words and morphemes in phrases and sentences to form meaningful combinations. As a result, syntactic complexity refers to the range, type, and complexity of syntactic structures, often quantifiable via measures such as the number of words per T-unit, the mean length of sentences, dependent clauses per clause, etc.
